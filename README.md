# triangular-arbitrage-spotter
This is a simple python program for spotting triangular arbitrage opportunities on the crypto currency exchange kraken.

The only requirment is the krakenex module. Information about this module can be found under https://github.com/veox/python3-krakenex
and the documentation can be found under https://python3-krakenex.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.

I created this project mainly for educational purposes to showcase how a triangular arbitrage can be performed. A walkthrough of the code can be found under https://medium.com/@raffaelschon/creating-a-simple-triangular-arbitrage-spotter-11684d14873d .
